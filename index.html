    <p>To Whom it may concern,</p>

    <p>
      I’m reaching out to express my interest in a Specialist Technical Support role in your team. With over 10 years in IT operations and support, I’ve built a solid foundation in managing servers, networks, and everything in between—especially when things go sideways and need quick fixing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, I’m part of the operations support team at Eezipay Management Systems, where I manage Linux-based systems, Docker environments, POS setups, and provide second- and third-line support. I also work closely with developers and clients, acting as the go-between to make sure issues are solved quickly and systems keep running smoothly.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m certified in CCNA, ITIL v3, and VMware, and have hands-on experience with a wide range of tools—Cisco, Fortinet, Exchange, Proxmox, you name it. My approach is simple: be proactive, stay calm under pressure, and always aim to make tech easier for others to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’d love the chance to bring this experience into a new environment where I can continue helping teams and users work better through solid tech support. Thanks for taking the time to consider my application—I’d be happy to chat more about how I can help.
    </p>

    <p>Best regards,<br/>Collin Smit</p>
